Hi 👋, I’m Mohammad El Musleh, an Embedded Systems Engineer with 3+ years of experience in developing, testing, and optimizing software solutions across industrial automation and service tools. I’m skilled in C#, C/C++, and Python, with a strong focus on building scalable applications that follow clean architecture, robust testing principles, and clean code practices.

I’ve had the opportunity to work with Bosch Thermotechnik GmbH through ALTEN GmbH (Germany 🇩🇪), where I contributed in developing and maintaining several in-house service tools used by technicians across Europe. These projects strengthened my expertise in C#/.NET, multithreaded applications, and testing automation.

Before that, I completed my Master’s in Embedded Systems at Uppsala University (Sweden 🇸🇪) and a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at Near East University (Cyprus 🇨🇾). During my master’s, I collaborated with NEVS (National Electric Vehicle Sweden) on research in automated test case generation and graph-based modeling, which led to published academic work.

My main technical interests include AI integration, robotics, process automation, and software architecture.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring technology trends (thanks to [Feedbro](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/)), refining my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking systems, learning new language (via [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and YouTube), GYM workout, and integrate AI into almost everything!
