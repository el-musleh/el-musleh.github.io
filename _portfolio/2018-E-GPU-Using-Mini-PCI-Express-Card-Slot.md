## Outcome:
- Evaluated the performance of an external GPU setup using a mini PCI-E 16x interface connected to a medium- range laptop by replacing the Wi-Fi card.
- Compared the performance of two different GPUs and a power-saving CPU connected to a 500W PSU, focusing on the impact on graphics processing efficiency.
