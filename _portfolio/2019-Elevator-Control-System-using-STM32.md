title: "Elevator Control System using STM32 MCU"
excerpt: "Development and deployment of a three-floor elevator control system using Model-Based Design (MBD). The system was modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, converted to C++ via Embedded Coder, and deployed on an STM32 microcontroller. Validation included MIL and HIL testing."

## Outcome:
- Developed an elevator control system using MATLAB/Simulink, designed to lift and halt a cabin across three floors, each with up/down call buttons.
- Configured signals in STM32Cube, created driver blocks in Simulink, and tested the model using MIL validation blocks.
- Converted the Simulink model to C++ code using Embedded Coder and deployed it on the STM32 MCU using Keil μVision. Testing was conducted using both Simulink HIL and manual testing.
